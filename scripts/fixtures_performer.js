To cope with being the chubby new kid almost every 3 years he learned to depend on being funny when it came to making new friends.  While this didn&#039;t have him hoisted upon the shoulders of his classmates, he was able to develop some very meaningful friendships along the way.  Fast forward to adulthood (at least according to age) Adam has lived in Portland, Oregon for over a decade. And his sense of humor has led to him being the guy among his friends who tells everyone the usually dumb (yet funny) story of all the foolishness that happened the night before.  This led to him wanting to get on stage and tell anyone he could get to listen, all of the dumb (yet funny) stories about all of the foolishness that&#039;s ever happened to him ever, as well as a few of his observations on life, sexuality, Ke$ha, and pretty much whatever he finds amusing.  All from the perspective of a not quite grown up who claims that &quot;While I haven&#039;t matured to the point where I&#039;m behaving the way a man my age is supposed to, I have managed to build a life that&#039;s capable of withstanding my bullshit&quot; It&#039;s not like he&#039;s lived this outrageously unique adventure that you couldn&#039;t fathom without him explaining it to you.
