If that wasn&#x2019;t too much to digest then you&#x2019;re ready for David&#x2019;s uniquely cerebral brand of humor. </p>\n<p>Born and raised in New York, David is one of the country&#039;&#x2019;s funniest up and coming philosophers posing as a stand-up comic.

Around the legally transformative age of 18 he straightened out his act, and shortly thereafter discovered his act on stage. </p>\n<p>Success and recognition came quickly. His popular Manhattan public access talk show grabbed the attention of MTV, and by his fourth year in comedy he&#x2019;d been featured on HBO, Showtime and MTV - many of his segments still being aired on VH-1&#x2019;s Best Pranks. He won the 2011 Boston Comedy Festival&#x2019;s New York Competition and was first runner up in the Comix at Foxwoods&#x2019; 2012 &#x201c;Last Comix Standing&#x201d; contest. He also consistently scripts one of the most popular philosophical blogs on stand-up comedy, davidfostercomedyblog.com. </p>\n<p>On stage David dissects the root causes of his anxieties and tells stories of how his adolescence staunchly contrasted with what his Jewish mother had envisioned for him. Philosophically he dissects the human stream of consciousness, criticizes our educational and medical systems, and refutes cynical perspectives, which is unique to what we hear from most stand-ups. While it&#x2019;s become common for comedians to make fun of things like spiritual faith, hip hop white guys, and natural forms of medicine, David brilliantly conveys the opposite perspectives with a hilarious and unique charisma.

One part comedy show, two parts drinking game, Brew Haha is a homegrown cocktail of debauchery and laughter that will make one homesick for the college days. Started by budding comedians in early 2013, The Brew Haha has become an underground sensation to those in the know. Before the first comic goes on stage, rules for the game are explained only to the audience. When comics, unbeknownst to them, break a rule, a light signals and the audience drinks. The rules are simple, but nobody is forced to participate, and the hosts ensure everyone gets home safe. It is a show that evokes that impossibly cool, fun speakeasy one might see in a film or on TV.

The RM teaches the audience about the “DRINK” sign (every time it lights up, a rule has been broken, and the audience takes a drink) and gives them the rules for the night. There are 5 set rules and 1 audience created rule. See below for some example rules. </p>\n<p>• The HOST comes back out, introduces all of the comics, and has them choose their order for the night out of a hat. Their place in the lineup determines the number of drinks they consume before their set. If you are comic #2, you have two drinks; if you are comic #6, six drinks.</p>\n<p>• The HOST then introduces JIMMY THE BARTENDER, who leads the comics and the audience in the bartenders toast, signifying the beginning of the show. The HOST introduces the first comic and the show begins.</p>\n<p>• During each set the rules broken are counted, and the comic who comes up next has to drink for that many seconds before they perform (ex. If comic #1 breaks 10 rules, comic #2 drinks for 10 seconds).</p>\n<p>• The show always ends with the hosts drinking for the amount of rules broken by the last comic. The rules are simple, but nobody is forced to participate, and the hosts ensure everyone gets home safe.</p>\n<p>• After the show, given the time and space…party time!</p>\n<p>Example Rules:</p>\n<p>• When a comic talks about a romantic relationship, past or present.<br />\n• When a comic talks to a specific member of the audience.<br />\n• When a comic tries to guess a rule.<br />\n• When a comic talks about race.<br />\n• When a comic uses a funny voice, or sings.</p>\n",PhotoUrl:"http://bridgetown.festivalthing.com/sites/default/files/images/show-submissions/brewhaha.jpg",id:"6347",SortOrder:"300",pageUrl:"6347-brew-haha-the-comedy-show-drinking-game"},{Name:"Hot Comedy w/The Spicy News",Copy:"Conceived by Portland comedian and Oregon native Craig May, The Spicy News was born when a group of friends believed that it would be funny to watch comedians read celebrity gossip, but only after eating one of the hottest naturally occurring chillies on the planet.
